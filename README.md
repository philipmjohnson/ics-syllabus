# ICS Syllabus Manager

A simple Meteor app for managing ICS syllabuses, including:

* Use of [Differential boilerplate](boilerplate.md)
* Login using UH CAS, restricted to ICS faculty accounts.
* Form-based editing of ICS syllabuses.
* Real-time notification when others are editing the same syllabus.
* Download of current syllabuses in JSON or Markdown format.

## Syllabus structure

A syllabus consists of the following fields:

  * Course alpha and number

  * Course title.

  * Instructor name and contact information.

  * Course description.

  * Course objectives.

  * Student learning outcomes. (To be selected from the ICS SLOs).

  * Number of credit hours

  * Prerequisites

  * Textbooks, required readings

  * Grading and Student Evaluation. (The assessment tools (exams, quizzes, projects, papers, journals, etc.) that will be used should be given, as well as the weight attributed to each. Note that the UH Catalog states explicitly that "final examinations are required in all undergraduate courses, except writing courses, directed reading, creative arts, research, seminars, internships, and field experiences) and must be taken during the scheduled examination period.")

  * Classroom policies (If none, just put None).

  * Weekly or daily schedule of topics and readings, including exam dates. (For most courses, PCC expects that the syllabus will include a day-by-day (or week-by-week, if appropriate) list of topics to be covered, accompanied by a list of readings that the students are expected to complete for each topic. Dates or deadlines for the various "devices" of evaluation (exams, papers, etc.) should be included. In rare cases where elements of an elaborate syllabus, such as the weekly schedule, are not appropriate (e.g., studio course in art, graduate seminars in subjects which rely heavily on recent articles from journals), then there can be some leeway in preparation of the syllabus.)
