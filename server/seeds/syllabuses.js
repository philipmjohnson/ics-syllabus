Know- Breadth and Depth of Knowledge\n\nStudents will develop their understanding of the world with emphasis on Hawaiâi by the use of geospatial data sets in the class, producing visualizations and therefore potentially hidden insights into regions of the world in relation to each other. Data may be about the economy, energy use, climate, for example.\n\n2. Do - Intellectual and Practical Skills\n\nStudents improve their abilities to think critically and creatively through designing, questioning and critiquing the visualizations produced by experts as well as their peers. Students conduct research by examining visualizations approaches used frequently online and described in conference and journal articles. Students improve their communication and reporting skills by having to give an oral presentation and demonstration of their visualization.\n\n3. Value - Personal and Social Responsibility\n\nStudents demonstrate excellence, integrity, and engagement through team-based collaborative projects that require them to learn how to work with differences in cultures and personal identities. Students will gain a better understanding of issues relating to the stewardship of he natural environment and civic participation in their communities through the data sets they will attempt to interpret and visualize.!",
