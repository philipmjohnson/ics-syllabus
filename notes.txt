To use session var to populate a form by selecting a value from another form:
* http://autoform.meteor.com/updateaf

Next step:
* Design a form with a pull-down menu and a select button labeled "Edit"
* On submit, the selected element should be stored into a session variable.
* This session variable should be used to determine the syllabus to be displayed.

* Note that the formType is set dynamically based upon the session variable state. That's cool. And buttons are disabled.

After saving an entry, should clear out session value so that display is blanked and user must press "Edit" again.
