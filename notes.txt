To use session var to populate a form by selecting a value from another form:
* http://autoform.meteor.com/updateaf

Next steps:
* Update readme with user guide, publish with github pages.
* Circulate for internal review.
* Single page for export
* Clean up code
* There's an app for that
* Create real-time edit status window
  - bootstrap scrollable window.
  - EditStatus collection.
    - create document upon "Edit" (course, timestamp, false)
    - update finished boolean to true upon save.
    - display in scrollable window, sorted by timestamp, if true add "finished".
    - code block, pre-scrollable: http://getbootstrap.com/css/#code-block
* Request t-shirt.

* Nice to have
- UH CAS authentication.
- Real-time updates.
- Don't display second form after save. Why is this so hard?
